This repository contains notes for my research into what I'm referring to as a "Unified CLI Framework". I expect that the work done here will not be particularly groundbreaking, and that's not the point.

What I hope to achieve is a better understanding of the universal components for any CLI application, in an attempt to identify a method for "unifying" the interaction between these components.

The research specifically applies to the Go programming language, however there will be some information relating to POSIX-type operations.

Everything will remain public as I'm working on it, however please know that there will be a lot of unsubstantiated opinion in some of the documents. The purpose of approaching this topic as a research endeavour is to allow me to better structure and form ideas, which involves identifying my weaknesses and misapprehentions.

Finally, I hope that my work here will prompt discussion, and help us all as progammers to create efficient, reusable, friendly code.

If you have any thoughts or contributions, please feel free to drop me an email.
